#Sorting Visualizer

I'm building a sorting visualizer for Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Selection Sort. 
This project aims to help users understand how different sorting algorithms work through real-time animations and visual feedback.

##Features
- Visualizes multiple sorting algorithms
- Real-time animations for better understanding
- Adjustable speed for animations
- Adjustable array size
- Randomized data generation for different visualizations
- User-friendly interface
